*🏗️ Project Description*

Project Overview
This Airline Passenger Satisfaction & Operational Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive Business Intelligence solution developed in Tableau. It transforms raw aviation data into actionable insights, focusing on the intersection between operational efficiency (delays/performance) and customer experience.

In a competitive 2026 travel market, this project identifies the "why" behind passenger churn and operational bottlenecks, providing a 360-degree view of airline health.

🔍 Key Analysis Performed

Customer Sentiment Mapping: Analyzed the correlation between flight distance, class (Business/Eco), and overall satisfaction scores.

Service Quality Benchmarking: Evaluated 10+ touchpoints including In-flight WiFi, Ease of Online Booking, Legroom, and Cleanliness.

Operational Performance: Investigated arrival and departure delays to identify patterns that negatively impact the Net Promoter Score (NPS).

Demographic Segmentation: Segmented data by gender, age group, and customer loyalty (Loyal vs. Disloyal) to pinpoint target areas for marketing improvements.

📊 Visualizations Included

KPI Scorecards: Instant visibility into average delay times and percentage of satisfied customers.

Bivariate Analysis: Scatter plots and heatmaps showing the relationship between age and travel preference.

Diverging Bar Charts: Comparing "Satisfied" vs. "Neutral/Dissatisfied" metrics across different service categories.

Trend Lines: Visualizing satisfaction scores over various flight distances to identify "comfort thresholds."
